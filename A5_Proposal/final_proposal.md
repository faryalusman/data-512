# A5: FINAL PROPOSAL 
# Research questions and/or hypotheses
## Research question: 
- What is the difference between the popularity of trending artists versus my favorite artists on Spotify?
- What is the difference in the music features between trending artists versus my favorite artists on Spotify?
## Hypothesis:
- For Question 1, I predict that my artists will be less popular than trending artists. However, some of my artists may be more popular than I realize. For example, while I may think piano and organ instrumentals are niche and ergo may think Hans Zimmer might not be extremely popular, he is also a world-famous score composer. 
- For Question 2, I predict the music features of my preferred artists to be slower and more mellow compared to popular artists. This means they will probably score lower on metrics such as danceability and loudness. However, this is a nebulous hypothesis. For example one of my favorite artists is Coldplay. My favorite song of Coldplay, *Yellow*, might be mellow and sweet. However another song such as *Princess of China* may be faster and score higher on the danceability / loudness scales.  

## Background/Related Work: 
While I do not have a research study that highlights which kinds of songs reach top playlists across the world, they usually tend to be from the Hip-Hop and R&B genre from the playlist browsing that I have done. This is different from my preferred tastes in music. This is why I chose the question of popularity and music features because I was interested in exploring the relationship between the two.

Current popular songs on Spotify that I used for reference can be accessed in [this link](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4hOKQuZbraPDIfaGbM3lKI).

In addition, I have also practiced pulling data from Spotify's API on music features so I know the various music features that data is available on — such as danceability, loudness etc. 



# Methodology: Not just what your analytical methods are, also why you chose them.
- I plan to initially use data visualization techniques such as glyphs (they can show importance across a range of features) and heatmaps (to show differences in popularity). A visual representation is immediately eye-catching and can highlight trends easily.
- I plan to use linear regression analysis or logistic regression to compare the differences between features and especially analyze if there is a correlation or relationships between them. This method is good to highlight statistical differences between the two.
