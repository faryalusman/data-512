# A5: FINAL PROPOSAL 
# Research questions and/or hypotheses
## Research question: 
- What is the difference between the popularity of trending artists versus my favorite artists on Spotify?
- What is the difference in the music features between trending artists versus my favorite artists on Spotify?
## Hypothesis:
- For Question 1, I predict that my artists will be less popular than trending artists
- For Question 2, I predict the music features of my preferred artists to be slower and more mellow compared to popular artists. 

## Background/Related Work: 
While I do not have a research study that highlights which kinds of songs reach top playlists across the world, they usually tend to be from the Hip-Hop and R&B genre from the playlist browsing that I have done. This is different from my preferred tastes in music. This is why I chose the question of popularity and music features.

Current popular songs on Spotify that I used for reference can be accessed in [this link](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4hOKQuZbraPDIfaGbM3lKI).


# Methodology: Not just what your analytical methods are, also why you chose them.
- I plan to initially use data visualization techniques such as glyphs (they can show importance across a range of features) and heatmaps (to show differences in popularity). A visual representation is immediately eye-catching and can highlight trends easily.
- I plan to use linear regression analysis or logistic regression to compare the differences between features and especially analyze if there is a correlation or relationships between them. This method is good to highlight statistical differences between the two.
